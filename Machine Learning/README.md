# Introduction to Machine Learning for NPTEL Course

This folders contains my comprehensive notes and resources on Machine Learning (ML), covering fundamental algorithms with in-depth explanations and practical applications which are essential for the NPTEL `Intoduction to Machine Learning` course.

## Objective

The goal of this section is to build a strong foundation in **Supervised Machine Learning** and **Unsupervised Machine Learning**.

It bridges theory, math intuition, and hands-on implementation to help understand how classical ML models learn from data.

## Contents

1. **Linear Regression**: Widely most used regression algorithm for predicting continuous values. Includes concepts like cost function, gradient descent and more.

2. **Shrinkage Methods**: Techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature space while retaining important information.

4. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Understanding the balance between bias and variance to optimize model performance.

5. **Cross-Validation**: Techniques to evaluate model performance and ensure robustness.

6. **Linear Classification**: The core of linear classification algorithms including logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis.

7. **Logistic Regression**: A fundamental algorithm for binary classification tasks.

8. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: A classification method that finds a linear combination of features to separate classes.
