# Complete Machine Learning Notes

![Machine Learning Intro](images/machine_learning.png)

## Overview

This repository documents my **entire journey of learning Machine Learning (ML)** — from the **machine learning algorithms** to **large language models**.  

It is designed to serve as a **complete reference** for anyone looking to understand ML, DL and LLM concepts deeply and systematically.  

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Covers fundamental algorithms, their workings, and applications.

- **Deep Learning**: Explores neural networks, architectures, and training techniques.

- **Transformers and Large Language Models**: Delves into the architecture, training, and applications of transformers and LLMs.
